# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz
```
As a coding bootcamp student
I want to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
so that I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Instructions
```
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score to LOCAL STORAGE
WHEN the game is reset
THEN the scores are pulled from LOCAL STORAGE
```
